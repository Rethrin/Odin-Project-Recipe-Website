        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley (optional)</li>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.
             Make a well in the center of the flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into the well, and add the olive oil, water, and 
            fresh herbs (if using).</li>
        <li>Using a fork, beat the eggs and the other ingredients together, 
            gradually incorporating the flour until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for 10-12 minutes, 
            until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into a ball and cover it with a clean dish towel. 
            Let it rest for 20-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>After the dough has rested, use a rolling pin or a 
            pasta maker to roll it out to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into your desired shape, such as fettuccine or linguine.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and add the fresh pasta. 
            Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, and serve it immediately with your favorite sauce.</li>
