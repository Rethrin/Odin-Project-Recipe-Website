        <li>1 (6 oz.) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tsp. dried basil</li>

        <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The Process:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375Â°F.</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions.
            Once cooked, rinse them in cold water and set them aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the ground beef 
            until it is browned and cooked through. Drain any excess 
            fat and add the onion and garlic to the skillet. 
            Cook until the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, 
            salt, and pepper to the skillet. Stir to combine and 
            simmer the sauce for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, 1 cup of the shredded mozzarella cheese, 
            1/2 cup of the grated Parmesan cheese, and the eggs until well combined.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 
            9x13 inch baking dish. Top with a layer of lasagna noodles, 
            followed by a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat these 
            layers until all ingredients are used up, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan 
            cheese on top of the lasagna.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven 
            for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 
            25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the 
            lasagna is heated through.</li>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. 
            Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and enjoy!</li>

        <p>This recipe makes approximately 8-10 servings, so it's perfect for 
            feeding a crowd. Enjoy!</p>
